## Introduction

Hello! 

My name is Christine Law and I'm a 4th year studying Economics and Data Science at the University of California, San Diego. ​

I'm passionate about intertwining my educational background of the business industry with my data analyst skillset such as identifying market trends/size, areas for improvement, and more. I've been able to funnel such passion through various projects throughout the school year including analyzing restaurant market size pre/post-pandemic, identifying impact of textual elements on recipe ratings, and more. 

I was the previous Marketing Analyst for Hunter Industries and I've created this repository to double as a creative report and blog to document my journey completing this project.
